# About
This repository is a collection of consulting style penetration testing reports from Hack the Box (HTB) machines. These reports were created for practice. They likely need additional refinement before they could be presented as a "final deliverable" at the end of an engagement.

Passwords, hashes, and other sensitive information are included in the reports in an effort to be thorough and as evidence of compromise. In a live engagement, this information shouldn't be present in a report because of the impacts associated with a sensitive information leak. Sensitive information that needs to be shared during an engagement should be shared via secure channels and access should be restricted in accordance with the principle of least privilege.

I'm always looking to learn and improve. Constructive feedback is welcome!
